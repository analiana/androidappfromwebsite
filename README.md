androidappfromwebsite

Android app displaying a website, supporting Facebook connect and displaying a loading bar when the user is loading a page.

To setup, just change line 28 indicating the starting URL of the app, line 29 with your website prefix, and line 30 with the HTML that the app will display in case of 404 error. Now open the folder with Android studio and just make the APK file.

I made this code public because there is too many scams on internet, like websites making you an app but telling you that you have to pay when you reach a certain amount of users to keep the app alive or showing adds to your visitors, or devellopers making you pay a very high price for this kind of app that is easy to code.

Enjoy :)
